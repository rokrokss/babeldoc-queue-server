# BabelDOC Queue Backend
<sup>main-queue API server ï¼‹ serverless worker</sup>

This repository contains two coordinated FastAPI services that together provide an **async, queue-backed PDF machine-translation pipeline powered by [BabelDOC](https://github.com/funstory-ai/BabelDOC)**.

| Component | Purpose | Default Port |
|-----------|---------|--------------|

| **Worker Server** (`worker_server.py`) | Stateless worker that pulls a queued job, runs BabelDOC translation, uploads the result, and reports progress back. | **8001** |
